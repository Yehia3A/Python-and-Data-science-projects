    "# Image Captioning with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's This Notebook About?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there! This notebook is an exciting adventure into generating captions for images using a fancy dataset from a Kaggle competition (Advanced Machine Learning 2025). We’re working with thousands of images and their captions to train a cutting-edge Transformer model that describes what’s happening in pictures. The biggest hurdle? Making sure our captions match the images perfectly, especially when some data files were missing or misaligned. We pulled it off, though, and scored in the private test set with a **BLEU score of 0.65**! Using Python, TensorFlow, and EfficientNetV2, we cleaned the data, extracted image features, built a Transformer, and generated captions like pros.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Did\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**: Installed libraries like `tensorflow`, `keras`, and `tqdm` for deep learning and progress tracking. We ran this on a Kaggle environment with two NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs for some serious computing power.\n",
    "- **Why It Matters**: This sets the stage for handling large image datasets and training complex models efficiently.\n",
    "- **Comment**: The GPU acceleration was a lifesaver for processing 6,472 training images and 810 test images!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Loading and Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**: Loaded the dataset with:\n",
    "  - **Training Set**: 6,472 images and 32,360 captions (`train.txt`).\n",
    "  - **Validation Set**: 809 images and 4,045 captions (`val.txt`).\n",
    "  - **Test Set**: 810 images (no captions provided).\n",
    "  - Checked folder contents and verified caption files existed. Noticed `.pkl` feature files were missing, so we generated them ourselves.\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Ensuring image files matched their captions was tricky—some invalid image names (like `image.jpg`) needed filtering.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Confirmed 6,472 training images, 809 validation images, and 810 test images, with clean caption files ready to go.\n",
    "- **Comment**: The dataset was massive, but organizing it early saved us headaches later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cleaning and Preprocessing Captions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Cleaned captions by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and adding `startseq` and `endseq` tokens.\n",
    "  - Used `Tokenizer` to build a vocabulary of 8,402 words from all captions.\n",
    "  - Filtered captions to match available images, ensuring no mismatches.\n",
    "- **Challenge**: The **most challenging part** was handling invalid or mismatched image names in caption files, which could’ve thrown off our model.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Created clean caption dictionaries with 32,360 training and 4,045 validation captions, perfectly aligned with images.\n",
    "- **Comment**: Adding `startseq` and `endseq` was key for the Transformer to know where captions begin and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Extracting Image Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Used **EfficientNetV2S** (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract 1,280-dimensional feature vectors from images.\n",
    "  - Applied data augmentation (random flips, brightness, contrast) to training images to make the model more robust.\n",
    "  - Saved features to `.pkl` files to avoid re-extracting them (saved tons of time!).\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Generated feature files for 6,472 training, 809 validation, and 810 test images, stored in `/kaggle/working`.\n",
    "- **Comment**: EfficientNetV2S was a beast, turning complex images into compact feature vectors in about 10 minutes for the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Building a Context Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Created a simple neural network to classify images as **indoor** or **outdoor** based on captions (using keywords like “park” or “kitchen”).\n",
    "  - Trained it on image features with labels derived from captions, achieving ~79% validation accuracy.\n",
    "- **Why It Matters**: Context labels (indoor/outdoor) were fed into the Transformer to improve caption relevance.\n",
    "- **Comment**: This step added a cool layer of context to our captions, like knowing if a scene was in a forest or a living room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Crafting the Transformer Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Built an **Encoder-Decoder Transformer** with:\n",
    "    - **Encoder**: Processed image features with self-attention and feed-forward layers.\n",
    "    - **Decoder**: Generated captions using self-attention, cross-attention with encoder outputs, and context labels.\n",
    "    - **Inputs**: Image features (1,280 dims), context labels (1 dim), and caption sequences.\n",
    "    - **Output**: Predicted the next word in the caption sequence (8,402 vocab size).\n",
    "  - Used positional encoding, multi-head attention (8 heads), and dropout (0.1-0.3) for robustness.\n",
    "  - Compiled with Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and categorical cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: A 16.7M-parameter model ready to generate captions, summarized with `model.summary()`.\n",
    "- **Comment**: The Transformer’s attention mechanism was like giving the model eyes to “focus” on key parts of the image and caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Training the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Trained the Transformer for 20 epochs with:\n",
    "    - **EarlyStopping**: Stopped if validation loss didn’t improve after 3 epochs.\n",
    "    - **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Halved learning rate if validation loss stalled.\n",
    "  - Used batched datasets (`train_dataset`, `val_dataset`) with 11,924 training steps per epoch.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Achieved a validation accuracy of ~14% and a validation loss of 0.4213. Captioning accuracy is low because it’s per-word, but the BLEU score tells the real story.\n",
    "- **Comment**: Training took ~4.5 hours per epoch, but the callbacks kept it from overfitting or wasting time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Generating Captions with Beam Search\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What We Did**:\n",
    "  - Used **beam search** (width=3) to generate captions for test images, picking the most likely sequence of words.\n",
    "  - Predicted context labels for test images using the classifier.\n",
    "  - Saved captions in `submission.csv` with 810 predictions in the format `image_id,caption`.\n",
    "- **Issue**: Some captions were repetitive (e.g., “a man in a blue shirt is walking through through through…”), indicating a need for better diversity control.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: Created a submission file that scored a **BLEU score of 0.65**, earning **1st place** in the Kaggle private test set!\n",
    "- **Comment**: Beam search made our captions more coherent than greedy decoding, but those repeats were a bit quirky.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was a rollercoaster of image captioning fun! The **biggest challenge** was dealing with mismatched or invalid image names in the caption files, which could’ve derailed our model if we hadn’t caught them early. We built a slick pipeline with EfficientNetV2 for image features, a Transformer for caption generation, and beam search for polished outputs. Adding context labels (indoor/outdoor) gave our captions an extra edge. Scoring a **BLEU score of 0.65**.\n"
